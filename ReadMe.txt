This project was worked on jointly by Alex Schuldberg And Young Chon. We collaberated in person and using git to complete the project.
Included in those folder are all of our code and the test cases as well as miscillainious solution files designed to be opened in Visual Studio 2012.
You should not need any special libraries or anything to run our code and it should work out of box.

Unit test results are in the /bin/debug folder, titled test results.


Thanks for grading
